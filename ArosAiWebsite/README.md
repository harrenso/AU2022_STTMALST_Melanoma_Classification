# ArosAiWebsite

This angular project is the frontend for the melanoma classification project. It enables the user to upload images (either from disk or using the webcam) and predict whether they have cancer or not. It should be noted that the results are not definite. A positive predicition should be interpreted as a suggestion to go to the doctor rather than a diagnosis.


The name of the website derives from the names of the team members and is also a reference to the art museum in Aarhus
