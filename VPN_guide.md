Hi, 

VPN 101 - how to connect:

Here's a link for AU page for VPN: https://studerende.au.dk/it-support/vpn

There you can go to manual for windows and mac:
First links are for installing a Cisco Client (follow the pictures or text me :-)

Then the second part is to connect to AU network.
There is also manual for that :-)

But in short:
1. run the client
2. for URL type: remote.au.dk/AU-ACCESS
3. enter your credentials 
4. You're connected :-)

If there would be any problem - try a few times if it doesn't works, try on the next day (I had some problems but the next day it worked)
