# Melanoma Classification Project
Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer.Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer,  responsible for 75 % of skin cancer deaths. It develops in the cells that produce melanin (the pigment that gives the skin its color). Melanomas can develop anywhere on the body, they most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as back, legs, arms and face. They can develop from existing moles or can occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.


This project uses the ISIC 2020 and the ISIC 2019 dataset to predict melanoma in pictures. It further provides options to deploy the resulting model. The project has been created by exchange students at Aarhus University.

## Delivery Overview
- data_preperation_20192020 : Download and prepare the data
- downsampling : Downsample the negative samples to avoid overfitting
- EfficientNetB0_model : Transfer learning to identify melanoma in images
- model_evaluation : Evaluate the performance using the hold out set
- explainable_ai : Explainable AI to understand model predicitions

### Deployment 
For the deployment, some further files have been supplied. For a overview over these files, please refer to the README in the corresponding folder. 

### Website
A website has been developed, which can be used by a user to access the model and use the service.
